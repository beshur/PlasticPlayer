# Plastic Player Arduino Controller

This is a rework of the original Plastic Player js version.

I found the ESP wi-fi module together with Raspberry Pi 
(both sitting on wi-fi network) is a bit too much,
so I want to optimize it by moving hard work of network
requests and wi-fi handling to Raspberry Pi.

## Parts list

- Arduino Uno (or maybe something smaller)
- SH1106 Display (128*32)
- Buttons
- Raspberry Pi (with Pi Musicbox)
